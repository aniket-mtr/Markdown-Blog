### Full Example in Markdown

Here's a complete Markdown example that includes a variety of formatting options, including code blocks:

```markdown
# My Markdown Document

## Section 1

This is a **bold** statement and *this is italicized*.

Here is a list of items:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Here is a [link](https://www.example.com) and an image ![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg).

> This is a blockquote.

### Code Example

Here is some inline code: `console.log('Hello, world!');`

And a code block:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}


Here is a table:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

---
That's all for now!

### Rendering the Markdown

When this Markdown is rendered (e.g., in a Markdown viewer or a website that supports Markdown), it will display as formatted text, with bold, italic, lists, links, images, blockquotes, code blocks, syntax-highlighted code blocks, and tables.

### Conclusion

Using these Markdown features, you can create well-structured and formatted documents that are easy to read and write. Markdown is widely used because of its simplicity and readability, both in raw and rendered forms.
